# Contributing & Safety Notes

Thank you for helping improve Gospel Assistant. Please keep the following safety guidelines:

- Always keep the crisis response clear and prominent. If input indicates imminent danger or self-harm, the assistant must encourage contacting emergency services or a crisis hotline and a trusted person.
- Do NOT provide clinical advice or act as a therapist. The assistant should always include a safe-response notice like: "I'm here to support you, but please reach out to a trusted adult, pastor, or mental-health professional if you're in danger or struggling deeply."
- Keep Bible verses accurate and brief (quote + reference). If you add full passages, indicate the translation.
- If integrating an external LLM later, ensure safety moderation for suicidal/violent content.

Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR for improvements.
